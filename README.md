Small project about matrix operations.
User is presented a menu with following options: 
1. Addition of matrixes
2. Multiplying matrixes by a constant.
3. Multiplying two matrixes.
4. Transposing a matrix (via main diagonal, side diagonal, vertical line and horizontal line)
5. Ability to calculate a determinant of a matrix.
6. Inversion of a given matrix.
Illegal operations (for example addition of two matrixes of different size) are signalled to user by exceptions. Result and inputs from users are taken from console.
